Week by week progress tracking during the Nazarbayev University Summer Research Program Internship
The project involves extracting relevant data from various online sources, including government databases, meteorological sites, and environmental platforms. 
Key data points such as soil type, moisture content, and climatic patterns like rainfall and temperature are gathered for analysis. This analysis will help to understand how these variables influence flooding in different regions of Kazakhstan. 
Finally, the project integrates spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to create a detailed map of flood susceptibility. 
By combining the extracted data and statistical insights, GIS tools allow for the visualization of flood-prone areas based on soil and climatic conditions. 
This map will serve as a valuable tool for predicting flood risks, aiding in disaster management and mitigation strategies across Kazakhstan.
Specifically, currently I work on Astana's snow cover's height (cm) to analyze the trend (2000-2025)
I will update this repository if there are any changes.
Now I need to do stacked columns and cumulative dataset, so I might need some time to do it.
